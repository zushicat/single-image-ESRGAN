# single-image-ESRGAN
Enhance low-res images with enhanced super-resolution ESRGAN (Keras / Tensorflow implementation).

The overall structure is based on this SRGAN implementation: https://github.com/zushicat/single-image-SRGAN.    
Please check out the according README for details on usage and the mechanics, since those basically apply here as well.     
Also, I try to avoid unnecessary redundancy and rather like to point out how the implementations differ from each other.
